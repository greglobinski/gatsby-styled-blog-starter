      <p>
        From Richard Hamming’s classic and must-read talk, “<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">
          You and Your Research
        </a>”.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          There is indeed an element of luck, and no, there isn’t. The prepared
          mind sooner or later finds something important and does it. So yes, it
          is luck.{" "}
          <em>
            The particular thing you do is luck, but that you do something is
            not.
          </em>
